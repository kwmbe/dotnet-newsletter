Small .NET API for newsletters

The API uses [Abstract API](https://www.abstractapi.com/guides/free-email-validation) for email validation. Be sure to add your own API key to the secrets in Visual Studio as `AbstractAPIKey`.
After this, use `docker compose up` in the root directory to start both the front- and backend.
